<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>

<h3>Glossary</h3>

By.the interaction?/Talking with the customer, here there is/it's exposed a (lil/essential) <b>glossary</b> about the meaning of the names and of the verbs included in the <a href="#req_text">requirements text</a> given by the customer.
<br><br>

<h3>Requirements analysis</h3>

Once we have understood the main concepts set by the <a href="#req_text">requirements text</a> given by the customer, it's now possible to analyze them (with top-down approach, doing/like a zooming on the system: structure - interactions - behavior).
<br><br>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>The software system is a distribuited system composed by three main entities:
	<ul>
		<li><ks>RBR</ks>, running on its own **robotNode**;</li>
		<li><ks>maître's smartphone</ks>, running on a **maitreNode**;</li>
		<li><ks>fridge</ks>, running on a **fridgeNode**. </li>
	</ul>
	</td>
	<td><img src="./utils/img/threeEntities.png" alt="three entities"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The software running on **maitreNode** must allow <ks>Maître de Salle</ks> to:
	<ul>
		<li>send the commands to <ks>RBR</ks> to execute tasks or to stop and reactive them;</li>
		<li>known and to show the objects related to each resources (smart and non-smart), so he must be able to comunicate with <ks>fridge</ks> too.</li>
	</ul>
	</td>
	<td rowspan="3"><img src="./utils/img/entitiesRel.png" alt="relationships between entities"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The software running on **robotNode** must be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>execute the <ks>task</ks> associated to command received by the <ks>maître's smartphone</ks>;</li>
		<li>stop/reactive a running <ks>task</ks> when it's required by the <ks>maître's smartphone</ks>;</li>
		<li>ask to <ks>fridge</ks> if it contains a specific food defined by a <ks>food-code</ks> and to receive the answer;</li>
		<li>send a warning to the <ks>maître's smartphone</ks> when the <ks>fridge</ks> doesn't contain the food required;</li>
		<li>return to his <ks>RH</ks> at the end of every <ks>task</ks>;</li>
		<li>avoid the impact with mobile obstacles.</li>
	</ul>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>The software running on **fridgeNode** must be able to:
		<ul>
		<li>answer to the <ks>maître's smartphone</ks>, via CoAP, with his content when it's required.</li>
		<li>answer to the <ks>RBR</ks>, via CoAP, when it asks if it contains a specific food.</li>
		</ul>

<h3>A first model of the system architecture</h3>

In particular, from this analysis and from the command names provided by the requirements text, we can realize a first model of the system architecture that is an initial representation of this system.

	- torna a posizione iniziale
	- é in grado di eseguire i task senza collisioni 
	- si ferma e riparte se riceve i comandi da parte del maître</td>

	command Task (prepare addfood(food-code) clear) 
	command handle (stop/restart)
	task ("Prepare the room" "Add food" "Clear the room")
}

Comunication Maitre - Fridge/Maitre : **consultCmd** {  
	command consult (ROOM)
	(Maitre knowns the state of non-smart elements, and asks to the smart devices to know their state)	
}
</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>Comunication RBR - Maitre fail:fail(m) {
	report of failure after receiving answer(no) from Fridge (if there isn't food=food-code in the fridge)

<tr>
<td><pre>Comunication Fridge -  Maitre expose : expose(state) {
	command expose after receiving command consult from Maitre
}

Comunication Fridge - RBR answer:answer(Y) Y(Y=[yes,no]) {

}
</pre></td>

<h3>Requirements traceability</h3>

[achievied from the requirement analysis]
Using a meta-model written in a machine-understandble language, like QActor, we can obtain a representation of the system architecture that describes the associations between requirements and the running elements (represented by the actors).
