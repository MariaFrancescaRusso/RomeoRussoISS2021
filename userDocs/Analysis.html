If the <ks>fridge</ks> doesn't contain that food, then the <ks>RBR</ks> sends a warning to the <ks>Maître de Salle</ks>; otherwise the <ks>RBR</ks> executes the <ks>task</ks> and then he returns to its <ks>RH</ks>.</li></ol></td>

<h4>Test Plans</h4>

It's necessary to make some test plans that must be verified for the correct working of the final system, according to the requirements provided by the customer.
<br>Below it's reported a first planning of tests:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Tests of the position of the <ks>RBR</ks> that must be on its <ks>RH</ks> when system starts and at the end of each <ks>task</ks>;</li>
<li>Tests of the states for each element (<ks>fridge</ks>, <ks>pantry</ks>, <ks>dishwasher</ks>, <ks>table</ks>) in the <ks>room</ks> in every moment of the service (start, end, end <ks>task</ks>, <em>consult</em> command);</li>
<li>Tests of all the communications between entities;</li>
<li>Tests of the path carried out by the <ks>RBR</ks> that must be the one expected to execute the <ks>task</ks> required by the <ks>Maître de Salle</ks>;</li>
<li>Tests of the mutual exclusion of <ks>tasks</ks> and of their order of execution;</li>
<li>Tests of the state of the <ks>RBR</ks> to verify that it is stopped after receiving <em>stop</em> command and to verify that it resumes <ks>task</ks> execution after receiving the <em>reactivate</em> command;</li>
<li>Tests of the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands that can be used by <ks>Maître de salle</ks> only when there is a running <ks>task</ks>;</li>
<li>Test of the capability of the <ks>RBR</ks> to <em>avoid</em> all the possible obstacles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A First Model of the System Architecture</h3>

From the requirements analysis, it's possible to obtain a first model, that is an initial representation of the system architecture, using a meta-model written in a machine-understandable language, like <tt>QActor</tt>, that describes the main interactions and behaviors between the main system components. In particular, the three main entities (<ks>RBR</ks>, <ks>maître's smartphone</ks>, <ks>fridge</ks>) are represented by three actors (QActors, that behave as <tt>Finite State Machines</tt> and work as <tt>CoAP</tt> observable resources) (<k>rbr</k>, <k>maitre</k>, <k>fridge</k>) and the nodes (<kc>robotNode</kc>, <kc>maitreNode</kc>, <kc>fridgeNode</kc>) where they run are represented by contexts (<k>ctxRBR</k>, <k>ctxMaitre</k>, <k>ctxFridge</k>).
<br><br>
Making this, there were been found some problems, that will be addressed and solved next in the problem analysis:
<ul>
	<li>the <em>stop</em>/<em>reactivate</em> feature is just described as a <ko>dispatcher</ko> but is still not working cause none state reads that message;</li>
	<li>the <em>consult</em> feature is still not completed cause it's necessary to manage the state information of smart and non-smart elements, but in this representation it's handled only the <ks>fridge</ks> state information.</li>
</ul>
Furthermore, the <ks>maitre</ks> is described here as a <tt>mock client</tt>, because it's early, in the requirements analysis, to represent his full proactive behavior that depend from a GUI.

<h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

<dl>
<dt><k>What To Do</k>:</dt>
<dd><ol>
<li>Identify the main (technical) problems involved by the requirements<br>
		+	the most appropriate (software) technologies (the best tools/libraries/supports etc.) to adopt that are necessary and/or useful for building the system<br>
		+	evaluate the abstraction gap and give a quantitative measure of the effort/resources necessary to build the system and clarify the constraints (human, technical, economical, etc.) related to both the software product to build and the software production process</li>
<li>Define (a model of) the logical architecture of the system</li>
<li>Refine the set of functional TestPlan</li>
<li>In the context of SCRUM:<ul>
	<li>define a (first) product backlog</li>
	<li>a possibile set/sequence of SPRINT</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Identification of the Problems and the Corresponding Solutions</h3>

Starting from the requirements analysis, it's now necessary to found the main problems and abstraction gap involved by the requirements and to solve them, establishing the most appropriate technologies necessary for building the system.
<dl>
	<dt>General System</dt>
	<dd>In the requirements analysis, there were been identified three main entities that run on different nodes, therefore the system is distribuited. To model it, it's available the <tt>Qak-infrastracture</tt>, provided by the <m>it.unibo.qakactor-2.4.jar</m> library. This framework provides a built-in message-driven tecnology to support the communications between different actors running on different contexts. In this way, it's possible to design the main components of the system using <tt>QActor</tt> meta-model.</dd>
	<br>
	<dd>To support the distribuited communications, it's possible to use the <tt>TCP</tt>, <tt>MQTT</tt> and/or <tt>CoAP</tt> protocols; the last one, by requirements, must be used by the <k>fridge</k> to communicate with the other two main components. In particular, <tt>MQTT</tt> is a IoT optimized messagging protocol which allows to implement a publish/subscribe interaction; while <tt>CoAP</tt> is a protocol for point-to-point comunications among different nodes on the same network. <tt>CoAP</tt> supports also the <i>observe mechanism</i> where the node state is seen as a resource (<tt>CoAP</tt>) observed by other <tt>CoAP</tt> clients.</dd>
	<br>
	<dd>In the <ks>room</ks> there are non-smart resources, whose states should be managed by the software system. This could be done in different ways, listed below.
	<br><br>
	<table>
	<tr>
		<td><ol><li>Using a resource manager actor (<k>rm</k>) which manages the state of each non-smart resource.

	<k>(?)</k>Therefore, exposed some possible solutions, the most appropriate seems to be the <a href="./Analysis.html#sol3_isr">number 3</a>, because it integrates best with the <tt>Qak-infrastructure</tt> and it is easier to manage/and this makes state management easier. <k>(?)</k> and allows to extend the functioning of the actors if the resources they represent, in future, assume a more advanced behavior.</dd>
	<br>
	<dd>Said where to memorize the state of each resource, now it's necessary to establish how to load these informations at start of the system. It can be done:
	<ol>
		<li><a name="sol1_pef"></a>creating, in the <tt>prolog</tt> file, (pre-existing) <tt>facts</tt> with a prefixed value for each resource state, which can be load at start of (the system) each resource actor;</li>
		<li><a name="sol2_arf"></a>providing the <k>maitre</k> with a configuration tool/adding in the maitre software application a configuration tool, so to make possible for the <ks>Maître de Salle</ks>/user (if it want) to insert or change the initial state values for each resource state in the room at the start of the system. This can be done (thanks to the possibility to add or remove a <tt>fact</tt>) removing old <tt>facts</tt> and adding new facts.</li>
	</ol>
	For an initial implementation of this system it will be adopted the <a href="./Analysis.html#sol1_pef">first solution</a>, but in future it could be ever "added" the <a href="./Analysis.html#sol2_arf">second solution</a>.</dd>
	<br>
	<dd>An other problem could be represented by the update of the state value of each resource. This could be done:
	<ol>
		<li>updating and so changing the old state values in the <tt>prolog</tt> file (removing old <tt>facts</tt> and adding the new ones);</li>
		<li><a name="sol2_usva"></a>loading at start of the system/each actor the/its state value from the/its <tt>prolog</tt> file and saving it in a variable, which will represent the resourse state value and which will update when necessary/required.</li>
	</ol>
	The best solution, to be implemented for the realization of this system, seems to be the <a href="./Analysis.html#sol2_usva">second</a>, because <k>(?)</k>in this way the resource state initial value never changes and ..... .</dd>
	<br>
	<k>IN MAITRE???</k>
	<dd>An other problem could be represented from <em>prepare</em> command/<ks>Prepare the room</ks> <ks>task</ks>. In fact, before sending this command, it's necessary to specify how much elements the <k>rbr</k> has to take from the resources ((<k>ACTORS OR RESOURCES???</k>) pantry and fridge) and bring to the table, being careful that the number of these elements is less or equal then the available number of elements. To do this, there are many possibilities, like:
	<ol>
	<li><a name="sol1_fpv"></a>using prefixed values for the number of elements in <em>prepare</em> commmand (in the code);</li>
	<li><a name="sol2_cbp"></a>making that the maitre (<k>ACTOR? or user?</k>) can decide how many elements to insert for the <em>prepare</em> command and, to do this, it's/it could be useful run a <em>consult</em> command at the start of the system, so as to have the updated resources state values which limit the choose of the elements (that must be less or equal then the available number of elements) by maitre.</li>
	</ol>
	(Said this,) the <a href="./Analysis.html#sol2_cbp">second solution</a> seems to be the best, because it is predisposed to a possibile future change of the resources initial state, while using the <a href="./Analysis.html#sol1_fpv">first solution</a>, in case of future change of the resources initial state, the code will have to be changed, that is never a good practice.<dd>
	<br>
	<dd>A similar problem could be represented from <em>addFood</em> (<k>metto food-code??</k>) command/<ks>Add food</ks> <ks>task</ks>. Here, before sending this command, the maitre must specify which element (food-code) the <k>rbr</k> must require to the <k>fridge</k> and, if possible, take and bring to the table. This can be done making possible for the maitre the choose of this element from/using the set of elements obtained through the <em>consult</em> command runned before the <em>prepare</em> command and used to obtain the resources state values.<dd>

	<dd>To be able to map the <ks>room</ks> and to satisfy the requirement <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i>, it's possible to use data collected from a sensor, which communicates through <ko>events</ko> with the <k>rbr</k>. This sensor can be rapresented, in the software system, by a sonar (in both virtual and real robot), whose library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m> is provided by the customer.</dd>

	<dd>The <k>rbr</k> it's both a proactive, because (perchè è proattivo?), and a reactive element, because it reacts to the commands received from <k>maitre</k> and to <ko>events</ko> received from sonar to <em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles.
