<h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

The problems related to this sprint goals, that are already addressed in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#ProblemAn" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, are detailed below.

<h3><a name="S2mapping"></a>Mapping</h3>

As already said in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to be able to map the <ks>room</ks>, it's possible to use data collected from a <tt>sensor</tt>, which can be represented by a <tt>sonar</tt> (in both virtual and real robot; in this Sprint, it will be a <tt>virtual robot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="_blank">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>) running on its own <tt>WEnv</tt> (Web Environment) to solve the goals about the execution of the <ks>tasks</ks>). In the library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m>, provided by the customer, the <tt>sonar</tt> is already integrated and used by the <k>basicrobot</k>.
<br><br>
Therefore, the mapping goal is to create a new <ks>room</ks> map, which in this sprint will be the virtual <ks>room</ks> in the <tt>WEnv</tt>, and to make possible this, it's necessary to communicate with the <k>basicrobot</k>, which, as already detailed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1basicRobot" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>, replies with a <em>stepfail</em> message in case it should find some obstacles (fixed, mobile or wall; in mapping case it will be sufficient to consider only fixed obstacles and walls).<br>
Furthermore, at each step carried out by the robot it's necessary also to update the <ks>room</ks> logical map and to do that it's useful the <tt>Planner</tt> support available in the library <m>it.unibo.planner20-1.0.jar</m> and discussed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1planning" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="S2PrAnAvoidObst"></a><i>Avoid the Impact with Obstacles</i> Requirement</h3>

By <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/utils/tf/TemaFinaleBo19.html" target="_blank">requirements</a>, the <ks>RBR</ks> must be able to <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i>; in particular, with mobile obstacles because walls and fixed obstacles (the <ks>table</ks>) are included in the <ks>room</ks> map, which in this sprint is produced by the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2mapping">mapping</a>.<br>

As already said <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2mapping">above</a> and in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to satisfy the requirement <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i>, it's possible to use data collected from a <tt>sensor</tt>, which can be represented by a <tt>sonar</tt> (in both virtual and real robot; in this Sprint, it will be a <tt>virtual robot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="_blank">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>) running on its own <tt>WEnv</tt> (Web Environment) to solve the goals about the execution of the <ks>tasks</ks>). In the library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m>, provided by the customer, the <tt>sonar</tt> is already integrated and used by the <k>basicrobot</k>.
<br><br>
Indeed, as already detailed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1basicRobot" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>, when the <k>basicrobot</k> meets an obstacle (fixed, mobile or wall) sends a <em>stepfail</em> message describing the cause of the failure and after how long it occured.
<br><br>
Therefore, to address this problem, it could be sufficient to manage the <em>stepfail</em> message received from the <k>basicrobot</k> and, to do this, there can be different ways:
<ol>
	<li>temporarily setting the obstacle in the logical map and planning a new path to reach the goal; so to get around the obstacle. Then, before starting the execution of the next steps, the obstacle must be deleted from the logical map;</li>
	<li>waiting for the mobile obstacle to move and so periodically carrying out the movement until the cell that must be occupied will be free.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="S2PrAnStopReact"></a>Stop and Reactivate Feature</h3>

By <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/utils/tf/TemaFinaleBo19.html" target="_blank">requirements</a>, the <ks>Ma√Ætre de Salle</ks> can use the <em>stop</em> or <em>reactivate</em> command to stop or restart an already activated <ks>task</ks>, otherwise these commands have no effect.<br>

In Sprint 1 it has been added a new <tt>actor</tt> (<a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1rbrWalker" target="_blank"><k>rbrwalker</k></a>) to manage the planning and the communicating with the <k>basicrobot</k> <tt>actor</tt> to make the robot perform the movements, whether it is virtual or real; in this case virtual.
<br><br>
Therefore, referring to the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#Sprint1Mod" target="_blank">result of the Sprint 1</a> and to the solution at this problem advanced in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to manage the the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands received by the <k>maitre</k>, during the execution of a <ks>task</ks>, a possible solution can be to use the <k>rbrwalker</k> <tt>actor</tt> which, splitting the path the robot must execute in a steps sequence, at the end of each step it can check if it has received a <em>stop</em> command and in this case it must wait for the <em>reactivate</em> command, otherwise it can carry out the next step.
<br><br>
The communications for sending these commands could be implemented in different ways<a name="S2PrAnSR4Sols"></a>:
<br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><ol><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands to the <k>rbr</k>, which takes care of sending these commands to the <k>rbrwalker</k>;</li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol1_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol1_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><ol start="2"><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send directly to the <k>rbrwalker</k> the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands as <ko>dispatch</ko>;</li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol2_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol2_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a name="sol3_stopReac"></a><ol start="3"><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send directly to the <k>rbrwalker</k> the <em>stop</em> command as a <ko>request</ko>, waiting for a failure or success <ko>reply</ko>, and, in the latter case, the <em>reactivate</em> command as a <ko>dispatch</ko>;</li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol3_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol3_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a name="sol4_stopReac"></a><ol start="4"><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands as <ko>events</ko> that can be received by all the interessed <tt>actors</tt>, that, for now, it's just the <k>rbrwalker</k>.</li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol4_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol4_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
From these solutions, the better choose, in this sprint, looks to be the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#sol3_stopReac">third one</a>, because it's the <k>rbrwalker</k> that is interessed to receive these commands since it takes care of communicating with the <k>basicrobot</k> to move the robot. In future, if the system complexity will evolve and there will be more <tt>actors</tt> interessed to these commands, it would be necessary to implement the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#sol4_stopReac">fourth solution</a>.

<h2>Test Plans</h2>

With reference to the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnTestPlans" target="_blank">initial problem analysis test plans</a>, below it's reported a functional tests planning related to the goals of this sprint:
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Tests of the state of the <ks>RBR</ks> to verify that it is stopped after receiving <em>stop</em> command and to verify that it resumes <ks>task</ks> execution after receiving the <em>reactivate</em> command;</li>
	<li>Tests of the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands that can be used by <ks>Ma√Ætre de salle</ks> only when there is a running <ks>task</ks>;</li>
	<li>Test of the capability of the <ks>RBR</ks> to <em>avoid</em> all the possible obstacles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project</h2>

<h3>Mapping</h3>

In Sprint 1, for the planning it has been created a project (<a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#mapBinGen" target="_blank">MapBinGenerator</a>) which creats a <ks>room</ks> logical map taking in input the dimension of the map to create and the coordinates of the obstacles.<br>
Instead, in this sprint, it has been introduced the mapping feature that provides a logical map of any type of room, either it is real or virtual, by exploiting the <k>basicrobot</k> to map it, without having to know the map dimensions or the obstacles positions.<br>
To realize this behavior it seemed to be more appropriate to create a new <tt>actor</tt> (<k>rbrmapper</k>) in <k>rbr</k> <tt>context</tt> (<k>ctxrbr</k>) which, after receiving the <ko>request</ko> <em>map</em> from the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt>, takes care of the <ks>room</ks> mapping and communicating with the <k>basicrobot</k> <tt>actor</tt> to make the robot perform the movements, whether it is virtual or real (in this case virtual), and to detect when the robot meets a wall or a fixed obstacle (the <ks>table</ks> in this case). To create the new map it has been used also the <tt>Planner</tt> support.
<br><br>
In particular, after receiving a <em>map</em> <ko>request</ko> from the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt>, the <k>rbrmapper</k> communicates with the <k>basicrobot</k> to move the robot making him explore the perimeter of the <ks>room</ks>:
<ol>
	<li>sending to the <k>basicrobot</k> a <ko>request</ko> message <em>step</em> for forward movements until it receives the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepfail</em> when the robot has met a wall; otherwise it updates the logical map using <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMap</em> every time it receives the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepdone</em>;</li>
	<li>sending to the <k>basicrobot</k>, once received <em>stepfail</em> <ko>reply</ko>, a <ko>dispatch</ko> message <em>cmd(<ac>l</ac>)</em> to turn left the robot.</li>
</ol>
The <k>rbrmapper</k> repeats this sequence of actions until it comes back to the <ks>RH</ks> position.<br>
Then, this <tt>actor</tt> starts to explore the internal spaces of the <ks>room</ks>:
<ol>
	<li>using the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>planForNextDirty</em>, which returns a list of actions to reach the first unexplored cell in the logical map;</li>
	<li>sending a <ko>request</ko> message <em>step</em> for forward movement, by waiting for the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepdone</em> or <em>stepfail</em> respectively in case of success or fail when the robot meets an obstacle (the <ks>table</ks>), and a <ko>dispatch</ko> message <em>cmd</em> for the other movements;</li>
	<li>updating at each step the logical map using the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMap</em> when it receives the <em>stepdone</em> <ko>reply</ko> or when it sends the <ko>dispatch</ko> <em>cmd</em> or using the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMapObstacleOnCurrentDirection</em> when it receives the <em>stepfail</em> <ko>reply</ko>.</li>
</ol>
The <k>rbrmapper</k> repeats this sequence of actions until it has explored every cell in the logical map.<br>
After this, this <tt>actor</tt> sends a <ko>request</ko> message <em>setGoal(<ac>0</ac>, <ac>0</ac>, <ac>downDir</ac>)</em> to the <k>rbrwalker</k> <tt>actor</tt> to make the robot to come back to the <ks>RH</ks> position with the correct direction.<br>
Afterwards, when the <k>rbrmapper</k> receives the <ko>reply</ko> <em>goalState</em> from the <k>rbrwalker</k>, it saves the created map through the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>saveRoomMap</em> and <ko>replies</ko> to the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt> with the message <em>mapdone</em>.<br>
Finally, it terminates itself.
<br><br>
It was introduced also the possibility for the <k>rbr</k> to know if the <ks>room</ks> logical map it's already present by consulting a <tt>prolog</tt> file (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/master/Sprint_2/SPRINT_2/IsMap.pl" target="_blank">IsMap.pl</a>) and in this case the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt> sends a <ko>dispatch</ko> <em>end</em> to the <k>rbrmapper</k> which terminate itself without executing the room mapping.

<h3><i>Avoid the Impact with Obstacles</i> Requirement</h3>

To solve the requirement <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i> it has been sufficient to extend the behavior of the <k>rbrwalker</k> by managing the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepfail</em> received by the <k>basicrobot</k> when the robot meets an obstacle.
<br><br>
In particular, as proposed during the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2PrAnAvoidObst">problem analysis of this goal</a>, two scenarios are distinguished:
<ul>
	<li>if the obstacle is in the goal position then the <k>rbrwalker</k> retries periodically the movement until the cell that must be occupied will be free;</li>
	<li>otherwise the obstacle it's temporarily added to the logical map by using the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMapObstacleOnCurrentDirection</em> and it's planned a new path with the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>planForGoal</em> to reach the goal; so to get around the obstacle. Before performing the next move, the obstacle it's removed from the logical map.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stop and Reactivate Feature</h3>

With reference to the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2PrAnStopReact">problem analysis about this goal</a>, to solve the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> feature, among the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2PrAnSR4Sols">four solutions</a> presented, the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#sol3_stopReac">third one</a> was chosen, where the <k>maitre</k> communicates directly with the <k>rbrwalker</k>.
<br><br>
In particular, the <k>maitre</k> can send a <em>stop</em> command to the <k>rbrwalker</k> as a <ko>request</ko> message.<br>
Then, the <k>rbrwalker</k> manages this message:
<ol>
	<li>checking if it has received the <em>stop</em> command not during the execution of a <ks>task</ks>, by verifying if the robot position in the logical map coincides with the <ks>RH</ks> position using the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>atHome</em> and in this case answering to the <k>maitre</k> with a <em>stopped(<ac>false</ac>)</em> <ko>reply</ko>; otherwise it procedes managing the <em>setGoal</em> or the <em>end</em> message;</li>
	<li>checking, at the end of each step, during the execution of a <ks>task</ks>, if it has received a <em>stop</em> command and in this case it sends a <ko>reply</ko> <em>stopped(<ac>true</ac>)</em> to the <k>maitre</k> and waits for the <em>reactivate</em> command; otherwise it can carry out the next step.</li>
</ol>
After that, when the <k>maitre</k> receives the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stopped(<ac>VALUE</ac>)</em> from the <k>rbrwalker</k>, only if <ac>VALUE</ac> is <ac>true</ac> it can send as a <ko>dispatch</ko> the <em>reactivate</em> command to the <k>rbrwalker</k>.

<h3>WEnv Scene for Virtual Robot</h3>

To make possible the simulation of the <tt>virtual robot</tt> on its <tt>WEnv</tt>, can be use the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/sceneConfig.js" target="_blank">sceneConfig.js</a> file used in <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1WEnv" target="_blank">Sprint 1</a>.
<br><br>
To add mobile obstacles in the <tt>WEnv</tt>, starting from this file, it's possible to uncomment and in case modify the part related to the <i>movingObstacles</i>. An example can be the scene represented below using the <a href="../sceneConfig.js" target="_blank">sceneConfig.js</a>.
<br><br>
Obliviously, during the mapping phase, the scene represented in the <tt>WEnv</tt> should be without mobile obstacles.

<h2>Testing</h2>

Below there are exposed some tests made for this sprint project:

<dl>
	<dt><a href="../test/it/unibo/test/StopAndReactivateTest.kt" target="_blank">StopAndReactivateTest.kt</a></dt>
	<dd>Tests about the correct execution of the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> feature:<ol>
		<li><em>StopAndReactivateTest</em>: after the send of a <em>stop</em> command to the <k>rbrwalker</k>, it's verified that the <em>stop</em> command fails when the <k>rbrwalker</k> is not executing a <ks>task</ks> and that has success when the <k>rbrwalker</k> is executing a <ks>task</ks>, stopping and waiting for a <em>reactivate</em> command. Then, after a send of a <em>reactivate</em> command, it's verified that the <k>rbrwalker</k> resumes <ks>task</ks> execution reaching the expected goal. In particular, this test:<ol>
			<li>Sends a <em>stop</em> <ko>request</ko> to <k>rbrwalker</k> <tt>actor</tt>;</li>
			<li>Checks that <em>stop</em> <ko>request</ko> fails;</li>
			<li>Sends a <em>setGoal</em> <ko>request</ko> to the <k>rbrwalker</k>;</li>
			<li>Sends again a <em>stop</em> <ko>request</ko> to the <k>rbrwalker</k>;</li>
			<li>Checks that <em>stop</em> <ko>request</ko> has success;</li>
			<li>Sends a <em>reactivate</em> <ko>dispatch</ko> to <k>rbrwalker</k>;</li>

	<li><em>AvoidMobileObstacleTest</em>: after placing an obstacle in the <tt>WEnv</tt>, in the expected path walked by the robot, it's verified that <k>rbrwalker</k>, even if meets an obstacle, reaches the expected goal. In particular, this test:<ol>
		<li>Sends a <em>setGoal</em> <ko>request</ko>;</li>
		<li>Cheks that an obstacle is met;</li>
		<li>Checks that the final robot position, taken from the <k>rbrwalker</k> state, is the expected one.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></dd>
</dl>
<br>
These tests are used to test the internal components of this sprint project and not the externals, like the <k>basicrobot</k>. The <tt>virtual robot</tt> movements, commanded by the <k>basicrobot</k>, can be visually verified by running the project and the <tt>WEnv</tt>.
<br><br>
These tests are executed on a single <tt>context</tt> (<k>ctxsystem</k>) and to execute them, it's necessary to comment the <k>maitre</k>, because it is a <tt>mock client</tt> and it could interfere with tests.

<h2><a name="Sprint2Deploy"></a>Deployment</h2>

The deployment of the application for the <tt>virtual robot</tt> can be done at the same way of the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#Sprint1Deploy" target="_blank">deployment explained in Sprint 1</a>.
<br><br>
As said in the previous sections of this sprint, the scene of the <tt>WEnv</tt> can be modify to introduce mobile obstacles and in this case the <a href="../sceneConfig.js" target="_blank">sceneConfig.js</a> file must be reload.<br>
Furthermore, to execute the mapping operation there must not be mobile obstacles in the <ks>room</ks> and it must be modify the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/master/Sprint_2/SPRINT_2/IsMap.pl" target="_blank">IsMap.pl</a> file, setting <ac>isMap</ac> value on <ac>false</ac>; otherwise on <ac>true</ac>.
