<h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

The problems related to this sprint goals, that are already addressed in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#ProblemAn" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, are detailed below.

<h3><a name="S2mapping"></a>Mapping</h3>

As already said in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to be able to map the <ks>room</ks>, it's possible to use data collected from a <tt>sensor</tt>, which can be represented by a <tt>sonar</tt> (in both virtual and real robot; in this Sprint, it will be a <tt>virtual robot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="_blank">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>) running on its own <tt>WEnv</tt> (Web Environment) to solve the goals about the execution of the <ks>tasks</ks>). In the library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m>, provided by the customer, the <tt>sonar</tt> is already integrated and used by the <k>basicrobot</k>.
<br><br>
Therefore, the mapping goal is to create a new <ks>room</ks> map, which in this sprint will be the virtual <ks>room</ks> in the <tt>WEnv</tt>, and to make possible this, it's necessary to communicate with the <k>basicrobot</k>, which, as already detailed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1basicRobot" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>, replies with a <em>stepfail</em> message in case it should find some obstacles (fixed, mobile or wall; in mapping case it will be sufficient to consider only fixed obstacles and walls).<br>
Furthermore, at each step carried out by the robot it's necessary also to update the <ks>room</ks> logical map and to do that it's useful the <tt>Planner</tt> support available in the library <m>it.unibo.planner20-1.0.jar</m> and discussed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1planning" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>.
<br><br>
<img src="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/utils/img/basicRobotInRBRctx.png" alt="basicRobot in RBR context">

<h3><i>Avoid the Impact with Obstacles</i> Requirement</h3>

By <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/utils/tf/TemaFinaleBo19.html" target="_blank">requirements</a>, the <ks>RBR</ks> must be able to <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i>; in particular, with mobile obstacles because walls and fixed obstacles (the <ks>table</ks>) are included in the <ks>room</ks> map, which in this sprint is produced by the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2mapping">mapping</a>.<br>

As already said <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2mapping">above</a> and in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to satisfy the requirement <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i>, it's possible to use data collected from a <tt>sensor</tt>, which can be represented by a <tt>sonar</tt> (in both virtual and real robot; in this Sprint, it will be a <tt>virtual robot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="_blank">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>) running on its own <tt>WEnv</tt> (Web Environment) to solve the goals about the execution of the <ks>tasks</ks>). In the library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m>, provided by the customer, the <tt>sonar</tt> is already integrated and used by the <k>basicrobot</k>.
<br><br>
Indeed, as already detailed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1basicRobot" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>, when the <k>basicrobot</k> meets an obstacle (fixed, mobile or wall) sends a <em>stepfail</em> message describing the cause of the failure and after how long it occured.
<br><br>
Therefore, to address this problem, it could be sufficient to manage the <em>stepfail</em> message received from the <k>basicrobot</k> and, to do this, there can be different ways:
<ol>
	<li>temporarily setting the obstacle in the logical map and planning a new path to reach the goal; so to get around the obstacle. Then, before starting the execution of the next steps, the obstacle must be deleted from the logical map;</li>
	<li>waiting for the mobile obstacle to move and so periodically carrying out the movement until the cell that must be occupied will be free.</li>
</ol>

<br><ko>SCRIVERE CHE LA SCELTA VIENE FATTA IN FASE DI PROGETTAZIONE? o che si potrebbe utilizzare la prima, ma nel caso in cui si trova l'ostacolo nella posizione del goal si potrebbe utilizzare la seconda soluzione.</ko>

<h3><em>Stop</em>/<em>Reactivate</em> Feature</h3>

By <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/utils/tf/TemaFinaleBo19.html" target="_blank">requirements</a>, the <ks>Ma√Ætre de Salle</ks> can use the <em>stop</em> or <em>reactivate</em> command to stop or restart an already activated <ks>task</ks>, otherwise these commands have no effect.
<br>
In Sprint 1 it has been added a new <tt>actor</tt> (<a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1rbrWalker" target="_blank"><k>rbrwalker</k></a>) to manage the planning and communicating with the <k>basicrobot</k> <tt>actor</tt> to make the robot perform the movements, whether it is virtual or real; in this case virtual.
<br>
Therefore, referring to the result of the Sprint 1 <ko>LINK a INTRODUZIONE sopra o a risultato SPRINT 1??</ko> and to hypothesis/solution at this problem advanced in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to manage the the <em>stop</em>/(and)<em>reactivate</em> commands received by the <k>maitre</k>, during the execution of a <ks>task</ks>, a possible solution can be to use the <k>rbrwalker</k> <tt>actor</tt> which, splitting the path the robot must execute in a steps sequence, at the end of each step it can check if it has received a <em>stop</em> command and in this case it must wait for the <em>reactivate</em> command, otherwise it can carry out the next step.
<br><br>
The communications for sending these commands could be implemented in different ways:
<br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><ol><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands to the <k>rbr</k>, which takes care of sending these commands to the <k>rbrwalker</k>;</li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol1_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol1_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><ol start="2"><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send directly to the <k>rbrwalker</k> the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands as <ko>dispatch</ko>;</li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol2_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol2_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a name="sol3_stopReac"></a><ol start="3"><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send directly to the <k>rbrwalker</k> the <em>stop</em> command as a <ko>request</ko>, waiting for a failure or success <ko>reply</ko>, and the <em>reactivate</em> command as a <ko>dispatch</ko>;</li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol3_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol3_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a name="sol4_stopReac"></a><ol start="4"><li>The <k>maitre</k> could send the <em>stop</em> command as an <ko>event</ko> that can be received by all the interessed <tt>actors</tt>, that, for now, it's just the <k>rbrwalker</k>. <ko>AGGIUNGERE REACTIVATE!</ko></li></ol></td>
		<td class="imageScenario"><img src="./utils/img/Sol4_StopReactivate.svg" alt="sol4_StopReactivate"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
From these solutions, the better choose, in this step/sprint, looks to be the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#sol3_stopReac">third one</a>, because it's the <k>rbrwalker</k> that is interessed to receive these commands since it takes care of communicating with the <k>basicrobot</k> to move the robot. In future, if the system complexity will evolve and there will be more <tt>actors</tt> interessed to these commands, it would be necessary to implement the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#sol4_stopReac">fourth solution</a>.

<h2>Test Plans</h2>

With reference to the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnTestPlans" target="_blank">initial problem analysis test plans</a>, below it's reported a functional tests planning related to the goals of this sprint:
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Tests of the state of the <ks>RBR</ks> to verify that it is stopped after receiving <em>stop</em> command and to verify that it resumes <ks>task</ks> execution after receiving the <em>reactivate</em> command;</li>
	<li>Tests of the <em>stop</em> and <em>reactivate</em> commands that can be used by <ks>Ma√Ætre de salle</ks> only when there is a running <ks>task</ks>;</li>
	<li>Test of the capability of the <ks>RBR</ks> to <em>avoid</em> all the possible obstacles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project</h2>

<h3>Mapping</h3>

In Sprint 1, for the planning it has been created a project (<a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#mapBinGen" target="_blank">MapBinGenerator</a>) which creats a <ks>room</ks> logical map taking in input the dimension of the map to create and the coordinates of the obstacles.<br>
Instead, in this sprint, it has been introduced the mapping feature that provides a logical map of any type of room, either it is real or virtual, by exploiting the <k>basicrobot</k> to map it, without having to know the map dimensions or the obstacles positions.<br>
To realize this behavior it seemed to be more appropriate to create a new <tt>actor</tt> (<k>rbrmapper</k>) in <k>rbr</k> <tt>context</tt> (<k>ctxrbr</k>) which, after receiving the <ko>request</ko> (<em>map</em>) from the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt>, takes care of the <ks>room</ks> mapping and communicating with the <k>basicrobot</k> <tt>actor</tt> to make the robot perform the movements, whether it is virtual or real (in this case virtual), and to detect when the robot meets a wall or a fixed obstacle (the <ks>table</ks> in this case). To create the new map it uses also the <tt>Planner</tt> support.
<br><br>
In particular, after receiving a <em>map</em> <ko>request</ko> from the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt>, the <k>rbrmapper</k> communicates with the <k>basicrobot</k> to move the robot making him explore the perimeter of the <ks>room</ks>:
<ol>
	<li>sending to the <k>basicrobot</k> a <ko>request</ko> message <em>step</em> for forward movements until it receives the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepfail</em> when the robot has met a wall; otherwise it updates the logical map using <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMap</em> every time it receives the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepdone</em>;</li>
	<li>sending to the <k>basicrobot</k>, once received <em>stepfail</em> <ko>reply</ko>, a <ko>dispatch</ko> message <em>cmd(<ac>l</ac>)</em> to turn left the robot.</li>
</ol>
The <k>rbrmapper</k> repeats this sequence of actions until it comes back to the <ks>RH</ks> position.<br>
Then, this <tt>actor</tt> starts to explore the internal spaces of the <ks>room</ks>:
<ol>
	<li>using the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>planForNextDirty</em>, which returns a list of actions to reach the first unexplored cell in the logical map;</li>
	<li>sending a <ko>request</ko> message <em>step</em> for forward movement, by waiting for the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepdone</em> or <em>stepfail</em> respectively in case of success or fail when the robot meets an obstacle (the <ks>table</ks>), and a <ko>dispatch</ko> message <em>cmd</em> for the other movements;</li>
	<li>updating at each step the logical map using <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMap</em>, when it receives the <em>stepdone</em> <ko>reply</ko> or when it sends the <ko>dispatch</ko> <em>cmd</em>, or the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMapObstacleOnCurrentDirection</em> when it receives the <em>stepfail</em> <ko>reply</ko>.</li>
</ol>
The <k>rbrmapper</k> repeats this sequence of actions until it has explored every cell in the logical map.<br>
After this, this <tt>actor</tt> sends a <ko>request</ko> message <em>setGoal(<ac>0</ac>, <ac>0</ac>, <ac>downDir</ac>)</em> to the <k>rbrwalker</k> <tt>actor</tt> to make the robot to come back to the <ks>RH</ks> position with the correct direction.<br>
Afterwards, when the <k>rbrmapper</k> receives the <ko>reply</ko> <em>goalState</em> from the <k>rbrwalker</k>, it saves the created map through the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>saveRoomMap</em> and <ko>replies</ko> to the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt> with the message <em>mapdone</em>.<br>
Finally, it terminates itself.
<br><br>
It was introduced also the possibility for the <k>rbr</k> to know if the <ks>room</ks> logical map it's already present by consulting a prolog file (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/master/Sprint_2/SPRINT_2/IsMap.pl" target="_blank">IsMap.pl</a>) and in this case the <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt> sends a <ko>dispatch</ko> <em>end</em> to the <k>rbrmapper</k> which terminate itself.

<h3><em>Stop</em>/<em>Reactivate</em> feature</h3>

Furthermore, it must be manage the possibility to receive the command before the execution of a task and in this case the stop request must be ignored.

<h2>Testing</h2>

Below there are exposed some tests made for this sprint project:

<dl>
	<dt><a href="../test/it/unibo/test/StopAndReactivateTest.kt" target="_blank">StopAndReactivateTest.kt</a></dt>
	<dd>Tests about the correct execution of the stop/reactivate feature:<ol>
		<li><em>StopAndReactivateTest</em>: it's tested that the stop command fail when the rbrwalker it's in a wait state and that has success when it's in moving step than it's tested that the reactivate command works.
		
		after the send of a <em>prepare</em> command to the <k>rbr</k>, which runs the <ks>Prepare the room</ks> <ks>task</ks>, it's verified that, for each sub-path the robot must execute, the final position of the robot is the expected one and that the reached resource state has been changed. In particular, this test:<ol>
			<li>Sends a <em>prepare</em> message to <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt>;</li>
			<li>Checks that the robot position, taken from the <k>rbrwalker</k> state, is the expected cell in front of <ks>pantry</ks>;</li>
			<li>Checks that the crockery removed from the <k>pantry</k> are the expected;</li>
			<li>Checks that the robot position, taken from the <k>rbrwalker</k> state, is the <ks>RH</ks> position.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></dd>
</dl>

Tests of the state of the <ks>RBR</ks> to verify that it is stopped after receiving <em>stop</em> command and to verify that it resumes <ks>task</ks> execution after receiving the <em>reactivate</em> command.

Test about the stop message:
 StopAndReactivateTest: it's tested that the stop command fail when the rbrwalker it's in a wait state and that has success when it's in moving step than it's tested that the reactivate command works.
 1. Sends a stop request to rbrwalker actor;
 2. Checks that stop request fails;
 3. Sends a setGaol message
 4. Sends a stop request to rbrwalker actor;
 5. Checks that stop request works;
