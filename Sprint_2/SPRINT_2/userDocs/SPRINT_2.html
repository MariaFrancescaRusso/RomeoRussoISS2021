<h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

The problems related to this sprint goals, that are already addressed in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#ProblemAn" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, are detailed below.

<h3><a name="S2mapping"></a>Mapping</h3>

As already said in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to be able to map the <ks>room</ks>, it's possible to use data collected from a <tt>sensor</tt>, which can be represented by a <tt>sonar</tt> (in both virtual and real robot; in this Sprint, it will be a <tt>virtual robot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="_blank">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>) running on its own <tt>WEnv</tt> (Web Environment) to solve the goals about the execution of the <ks>tasks</ks>). In the library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m>, provided by the customer, the <tt>sonar</tt> is already integrated and used by the <k>basicrobot</k>.
<br><br>
Therefore, the mapping goal is to create a new <ks>room</ks> map, which in this sprint will be the virtual <ks>room</ks> in the <tt>WEnv</tt>, and to make possible this, it's necessary to communicate with the <k>basicrobot</k>, which, as already detailed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1basicRobot" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>, replies with a <em>stepfail</em> message in case it should find some obstacles (fixed, mobile or wall; in mapping case it will be sufficient to consider only fixed obstacles and walls).<br>
Furthermore, at each step carried out by the robot it's necessary also to update the <ks>room</ks> logical map and to do that it's useful the <tt>Planner</tt> support available in the library <m>it.unibo.planner20-1.0.jar</m> and discussed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1planning" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>.
<br><br>

<h3><i>Avoid the Impact with Obstacles</i> Requirement</h3>

By <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/utils/tf/TemaFinaleBo19.html" target="_blank">requirements</a>, the <ks>RBR</ks> must be able to <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i>; in particular, with mobile obstacles because walls and fixed obstacles (the <ks>table</ks>) are included in the <ks>room</ks> map, which in this sprint is produced by the <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2mapping">mapping</a>.<br>

As already said <a href="./SPRINT_2.html#S2mapping">above</a> and in the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnRBR" target="_blank">initial problem analysis</a>, to satisfy the requirement <i><em>avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i>, it's possible to use data collected from a <tt>sensor</tt>, which can be represented by a <tt>sonar</tt> (in both virtual and real robot; in this Sprint, it will be a <tt>virtual robot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="_blank">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>) running on its own <tt>WEnv</tt> (Web Environment) to solve the goals about the execution of the <ks>tasks</ks>). In the library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m>, provided by the customer, the <tt>sonar</tt> is already integrated and used by the <k>basicrobot</k>.
<br><br>
Indeed, as already detailed in the <a href="../../../Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/userDocs/SPRINT_1.html#S1basicRobot" target="_blank">Sprint 1 problem analysis</a>, when the <k>basicrobot</k> meets an obstacle (fixed, mobile or wall) sends a <em>stepfail</em> message describing the cause of the failure and after how long it occured.
<br><br>
SO TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM TWO WAYS ARE POSSIBLE. 
1. SETTING UP TEMPORARILY THE OBSTACLE IN THE MAP AND CALCULATING ANOTHER PLAN TO THE GAOL, BEFORE STARTING MOVING THE MOBILE OBSTACLE IT'S DELETED FROM THE MAP.
2. AFTER THE MEETING WITH A MOBILE OBSTACLE THE RBR WAITS FOR THE OBSTACLE WALKS AWAY AND RETRY THE MOVEMENT PERIODICALY WHILE THE NEXT CELL IT'S FREE.
<br><br>
Pertanto come soluzione a questo problema potrebbe essere sufficiente/necessario gestire tale messaggio e per farlo ci possono essere diversi scenari:
1. reinviando uno step command al basicrobot di durata DURATION in modo da arrivare di fronte all'ostacolo e settare temporaneamente l'ostacolo nella mappa logica e ricalcolare il percorso per il goal in modo da aggirare l'ostacolo;
2. attendere che l'ostacolo mobile si sposti e ritentare il passo e poi continuare la sequenza di passi fino a raggiungere il goal
<br><br>
//TODO: gestire l'ostacolo nel caso in cui occupi il goal:
				//Sol 1. fare in modo che il robot aspetti che si sposti l'ostacolo
				//Sol 2. se il goal è la home allora sol 1; se il goal è una risorsa allora si cerca l altro goal più vicino?
			//Si sceglie sol 1


<h3><em>Stop</em>/<em>Reactivate</em> feature</h3>

--------PROBLEM ANALYSIS-----------
To manage the the stop/reactivate commands received by the maitre, during the execution of each task, it's possible to split the path, the rbr must execute, in a steps sequence. In this way, at the end of each step the rbr checks if it has received a stop command and in this case it saves its state and waits for the reactivate command, otherwise it carries out the next step.
<br><br>
TO MANAGE THE STOP/REACTIVATE COMMANDS RECEIVED BY THE MAITRE, IT'S SUFFICIENT TO WAIT FOR A STOP MESSAGE IN THE RBRWALKER ACTOR BEFORE THE EXECUTION OF ANY MOVE, AND WHILE IT 'S WAITING FOR A NEW GOAL AND IT'S NOT IN THE RH.

<h2>Test Plans</h2>

With reference to the <a href="../../../ProblemAnalysisModel/userDocs/Analysis.html#PrAnTestPlans" target="_blank">previous problem analysis test plans</a>, below it's reported a functional tests planning related to the goals of this sprint:
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Tests of the position of the <ks>RBR</ks> that must be on its <ks>RH</ks> when system starts and at the end of each <ks>task</ks>;</li>
	<li>Tests of the path carried out by the <ks>RBR</ks> that must be the one expected to execute the <ks>task</ks> required by the <ks>Maître de Salle</ks>;</li>
	<li>Tests of the state of the <ks>RBR</ks> to verify that it is stopped after receiving <em>stop</em> command and to verify that it resumes <ks>task</ks> execution after receiving the <em>reactivate</em> command;</li>
	<li>Test of the capability of the <ks>RBR</ks> to <em>avoid</em> all the possible obstacles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project</h2>

<h3>Mapping</h3>

# Mapper
The custumer requirements ask to do a mapping step to make the robot able to adapt its movements to any room enviroment. To get this behaviur the Mapper actor is builted.
In the Mapper actor a map is obteined exploring the perimeter of the room and than exploring the internal space to found the table position.

<h3><i><em>Avoid</em> the impact with obstacles</i> requirement</h3>

<h3><em>Stop</em>/<em>Reactivate</em> feature</h3>

<h2>Testing</h2>

Below there are exposed some tests made for this sprint project:

<dl>
	<dt><a href="../test/it/unibo/test/StopAndReactivateTest.kt" target="_blank">StopAndReactivateTest.kt</a></dt>
	<dd>Tests about the correct execution of the stop/reactivate feature:<ol>
		<li><em>StopAndReactivateTest</em>: it's tested that the stop command fail when the rbrwalker it's in a wait state and that has success when it's in moving step than it's tested that the reactivate command works.
		
		after the send of a <em>prepare</em> command to the <k>rbr</k>, which runs the <ks>Prepare the room</ks> <ks>task</ks>, it's verified that, for each sub-path the robot must execute, the final position of the robot is the expected one and that the reached resource state has been changed. In particular, this test:<ol>
			<li>Sends a <em>prepare</em> message to <k>rbr</k> <tt>actor</tt>;</li>
			<li>Checks that the robot position, taken from the <k>rbrwalker</k> state, is the expected cell in front of <ks>pantry</ks>;</li>
			<li>Checks that the crockery removed from the <k>pantry</k> are the expected;</li>
			<li>Checks that the robot position, taken from the <k>rbrwalker</k> state, is the <ks>RH</ks> position.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></dd>
</dl>

Tests of the state of the <ks>RBR</ks> to verify that it is stopped after receiving <em>stop</em> command and to verify that it resumes <ks>task</ks> execution after receiving the <em>reactivate</em> command.

Test about the stop message:
 StopAndReactivateTest: it's tested that the stop command fail when the rbrwalker it's in a wait state and that has success when it's in moving step than it's tested that the reactivate command works.
 1. Sends a stop request to rbrwalker actor;
 2. Checks that stop request fails;
 3. Sends a setGaol message
 4. Sends a stop request to rbrwalker actor;
 5. Checks that stop request works;
 6. Sends a reactivate message;
 7.  Checks that reactivate request works;
 8. Checks that the final robot position, taken from the rbrwalker state, is the expected one;
