<h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

The problems related to this sprint goals, that are already addressed in the previous problem analysis <k>[METTERE LINK]</k>, are detailed below.

<h3>Food Consumption</h3>

By requirements, to execute the <ks>Clear the room</ks> <ks>task</ks>, the <ks>RBR</ks> must take non-consumed food from the <ks>table</ks> and bring it to the <ks>fridge</ks>. Therefore, it's necessary a way to simulate the food consumption.<br>

In the previous problem analysis <k>[Inserire link a table-analisi problema]</k>, various solutions about this problem have been exposed. From these solutions and after some reflections, the most suited solution seem to be the following: the consumption of food on the <ks>table</ks> could be managed by simulating people in the <ks>room</ks>, which consume the food on the <ks>table</ks>, so as to make it no longer available.<br>
To do this, it can be introduced a new <tt>mock</tt> <k>actor</k> which interacts, after the <ks>Prepare the room</ks> <ks>task</ks> and before the <ks>Clear the room</ks> <ks>task</ks>, with the <k>table</k> to change its state.
<br>

<h3>Planning</h3>

As already said in the previous problem analysis <k>[Inserire link a planner-analisi problema]</k>, it's available a support, <m>it.unibo.planner20-1.0.jar</m>, which allows <k>rbr</k>, at its boot, to create a map of the <ks>room</ks> or to load an existing one. This allows the <k>rbr</k> to know where the elements which he has to interact (<ks>fridge</ks>, <ks>dishwasher</ks>, <ks>pantry</ks>, <ks>table</ks>) and the <ks>RH</ks> are situated in the <ks>room</ks>, so it can reach them.
<br><br>
The planning feature (documented at <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.cautiousExplorer/userDocs/LabPlanner2021.html" target="_blank">LabPlanner2021.html</a>) is the capability to plan actions in a logical space. This space is a map described by a set of square cells whose edges are robot sized. So it's possible to see a step of the robot as the ingress in a new cell. Furthermore, the <tt>Planner</tt> keeps track of the current logical position of the robot in the map.
<br><br>
Some of the most useful operations provided by the <tt>Planner</tt> (in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.cautiousExplorer/app/src/main/kotlin/itunibo/planner/plannerUtil.kt" target="_blank">it.unibo.plannerUtil</a>) are:
<ul>
	<li><em>initAI()</em>, which initializes the <tt>Planner</tt> assuming that the robot is in the robot home position;</li>
	<li><em>loadRoomMap(<ac>fname:String</ac>)</em>, which allows the system to load a map;</li>
	<li><em>showMap()</em>, which allow the system to print the map;</li>
	<li><em>planGoal(<ac>x:int</ac>, <ac>y:int</ac>)</em>, which allows the system to set a goal to be reached providing the coordinates of the goal cell;</li>
	<li><em>doPlan()</em>, which allows the system to get the moves, as a list of actions, to reach the goal from the current position;</li>
	<li><em>getNextPlannedMove()</em>, which allows to get the next move from the list of actions;</li>
	<li><em>planForGoal(<ac>x:String</ac>, <ac>y:String</ac>)</em>, which executes in sequence <em>planGoal</em> and <em>doPlan</em> operations;</li>
	<li><em>updateMap(<ac>move:String</ac>, <ac>msg:String=""</ac>)</em>, which allows to realize a move of the robot updating its position in the logical map;</li>
	<li><em>get_curPos()</em>, which returns the current logical position of the robot in the map;</li>
	<li><em>getDirection()</em>, which returns the current logical direction of the robot in the map.</li>
</ul>

<h3>basicRobot</h3>

As already said in the previous problem analysis <k>[Inserire link a basicRobot-analisi problema]</k>, the <tt>basicRobot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot/userDocs/basicrobot2021.html" target="_blank">basicrobot2021.html</a>), provided by the customer in the library <m>it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot-1.0.jar</m>, is a component useful for the execution of the movements of the robot, which, in this Sprint, will be a <tt>virtual robot</tt> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="_blank">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>) running on its own <tt>WEnv</tt> (Web Environment) to solve the goals about the execution of the <ks>tasks</ks>.
<br><br>
In particular, the <tt>actor</tt> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatali/issLab2021/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot/src/basicrobot.qak" target="_blank"><k>basicrobot</k></a> is able to execute basic move commands received through:
<ul>
	<li>a <ko>dispatch</ko> <em>cmd:cmd(<ac>MOVE</ac>)</em>, where <ac>MOVE</ac> can be <ac>w</ac> to move forward, <ac>s</ac> to move backward, <ac>l</ac> to turn left, <ac>r</ac> to turn right or <ac>h</ac> to stop the robot;</li>
	<li>a <ko>request</ko> <em>step:step(<ac>TIME</ac>)</em>, to move forward the robot for a prefixed time <ac>TIME</ac>. At this request the <k>basicrobot</k> can <ko>reply</ko> with <em>stepdone:stepdone(<ac>V</ac>)</em> if the command execution ends successfully or with <em>stepfail:stepfail(<ac>DURATION</ac>, <ac>CAUSE</ac>)</em> if it fails after the time <ac>DURATION</ac> for some reason <ac>CAUSE</ac>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<k>[Inserire img: rbr --> (dispatch e request) --> basicRobot -->? WEnv]</k>

<h2>Test Plans</h2>

With reference to the previous problem analysis test plans <k>[Inserire link]</k>, below it's reported a functional tests planning related to the goals of this sprint:
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Tests of the position of the <ks>RBR</ks> that must be on its <ks>RH</ks> when system starts and at the end of each <ks>task</ks>;</li>
	<li>Tests of the path carried out by the <ks>RBR</ks> that must be the one expected to execute the <ks>task</ks> required by the <ks>Ma√Ætre de Salle</ks>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project</h2>

<h3>Food Consumption</h3>

To make possible the consumption of the food on the <ks>table</ks>, it has been added a <tt>mock actor</tt> <k>foodconsumer</k> in the <k>[COME SCRIVERE CONTEXT]</k> maitre context which send a <ko>dispatch</ko> message (<em>changeState(remove, <ac>FOOD</ac>)</em>) to change the state of the <k>table</k>, so to remove some food <ac>FOOD</ac>. The elements to remove from the <k>table</k> are loaded from a <tt>prolog</tt> file (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/master/Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/Consumer.pl" target="_blank">Consumer.pl</a>).
<br><br>
<k>[IMG: mock actor part from qak?]</k><br>
<k>[IMG: ctxmaitre: FoodConsumer --> dispatch --> Table --> updateState --> obsTable --> event + IMG STATI Attore]</k>

<h3>Planning and BasicRobot</h3>

To realize the project part about the planning it has been necessary, in a first phase, to design and create a project <a href="https://github.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/tree/master/Sprint_1/MapBinGenerator" target="_blank">MapBinGenerator</a> able to create a <k>[EVIDENZIO??]</k>.bin file of the logical map useful for the <tt>Planner</tt> component which take it as input for the command <em>loadRoomMap</em>.
<br><br>
In a second phase it seems to be more appropriate to create an other <tt>actor</tt> (<k>rbrwalker</k>) in rbr context <k>[COME SCRIVERE CONTEXT]</k> which takes care of the planning and communicating with the <k>basicrobot</k> <tt>actor</tt> to make the robot perform the movements, whether it is <tt>virtual</tt> or <tt>real</tt>; in this case <tt>virtual</tt>.
<br><br>
To take the coordinates of the possible goals for the <ks>tasks</ks> paths, also useful for the command <em>planForGoal</em> used by the <tt>Planner</tt> to found the sequence of actions the <k>basicrobot</k> must execute, it has been created a <tt>prolog</tt> file <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/master/Sprint_1/SPRINT_1/ResourcesCoordinates.pl" target="_blank">ResourcesCoordinates.pl</a>. In particular, this file manages the possible goals, that are the coordinates of the <ks>RH</ks> cell and of the cells close to the resources (<ks>pantry</ks>, <ks>dishwasher</ks>, <ks>table</ks> and <ks>fridge</ks>) that the robot could occupy, and provides to the <k>rbr</k> the nearest goal to the robot current position.

<h4>MapBinGenerator</h4>

To emulate the <ks>room</ks> enviroment, it has been realized a small application <a href="https://github.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/tree/master/Sprint_1/MapBinGenerator" target="_blank">MapBinGenerator</a> <k>LINK AL FILE .kt???</k> that, taking in input the dimension of the map to create and the coordinates of the obstacles, provides a <k>[EVIDENZIO??]</k>.txt file and a <k>[EVIDENZIO??]</k>.bin file of the map; the last one must be used as input map for the <tt>Planner</tt>, creating, for this sprint project, a cells based map with dimension 7x7 <ac>7x7</ac> <k>[SCRIVO COME GLI ARG??]</k> and adding, in the center of the map, an obstacle which represents the <ks>table</ks>.
<br><br>
<k>[IMAGE OF THE ROOM PLAN + AFFIANCATA A + DISEGNO DATO DA PROFF NEI REQUISITI]</k>

<h4>RBRWalker Actor</h4>

To integrare the planning and movement feature for the robot, it has been introduced a new <tt>actor</tt>, that is the <k>rbrwalker</k>.<br>
At its start, this component load the <k>[EVIDENZIO??]</k>.bin file of the map <a href="../roomMap.txt" target="_blank">roomMap</a> <k>[LINK txt???]</k>, obtained previously thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bluffgnuff/RomeoRussoISS2021/tree/master/Sprint_1/MapBinGenerator" target="_blank">MapBinGenerator</a> <k>LINK AL FILE .kt???</k> project, running the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>loadRoomMap</em>.<br>
This actor receives as a <ko>request</ko> from the <tt>actor</tt> <k>rbr</k> the <em>setGoal(<ac>X</ac>, <ac>Y</ac>, <ac>DIR</ac>)</em> message, where <ac>X</ac> and <ac>Y</ac> are the coordinates of the goal and <ac>DIR</ac> is the direction expected of the robot, which it's supposed to be in front of the goal resource.<br>
After that, the <k>rbrwalker</k> executes the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>planForGoal</em>, obtaining a list of actions that represent the movements the robot must execute, at the end of each which it updates the logical map using <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>updateMap</em>.<br>
To make possible these movement for the robot, the <k>rbrwalker</k> communicates with the <tt>actor</tt> <k>basicrobot</k>, sending it a <ko>request</ko> message <em>step</em> for forward movement, by waiting for the <ko>reply</ko> <em>stepdone</em> or <em>stepfail</em> respectively in case of success or fail, and a <ko>dispatch</ko> message <em>cmd</em> for the other movements.<br>
Furthermore, the <k>rbrwalker</k> makes a check on the robot direction once it has reached the goal, turning it if the current direction, taken thanks to the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>getDirection</em>, isn't equal to the expected one (<ac>DIR</ac>).<br>
Reached the required goal, the <k>rbrwalker</k> <tt>actor</tt> <ko>reply</ko> to the <k>rbr</k> with the message <em>goalState(<ac>POS</ac>)</em>, where <ac>POS</ac> is the current position of the robot taken thanks to the <tt>Planner</tt> command <em>get_curPos</em>.

<h3>WEnv Scene for Virtual Robot</h3>

To make possible the simulation of the <tt>virtual robot</tt> on its <tt>WEnv</tt>, starting from the example <k>[LINK AL FILE DEL PROFF???]</k> provided by the customer with the requirements text <k>[LINK A REQ TEXT??]</k>, it's been realized a scene <a href="../sceneConfig.js" target="_blank">sceneConfig.js</a> that reflects the logic map as much as possible.
