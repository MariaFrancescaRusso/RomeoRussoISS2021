# Requirement analysis
1. Our software system is a distribuited system composed by three main entities: 
- Room Butler Robot (**RBR**), running on its own **robotNode** and that can be a real or a virtual robot;
- Maitre de salle (**maitre**), running on a **maitreNode** and that can be a smartphone application or a user-GUI in a browser;
- Smart-Fridge (**fridge**), running on a **fridgeNode**. 
3. [To understand (or formally define) what is the meaning of the term robot, we must read UsingRobots2019.pdf]
2. The software running on **maitreNode** must allow Maitre de sall to:
- send the commands to **RBR** to execute tasks or to stop and reactive them.
- to known the object related to each resources (smart and non-smart), so he must be able to comunicate with **fridge**.

4. The software running on **robotNode** must be able to:
- execute the **task** associated to command received by the **maitre**. 
- return to his *start position* at the end of every **task**.
- comunicate with **fridge** and **maitre**. **-------------------------------------------**
- avoid the impact with mobile obstacles (e.g. a sonar, a camera, a proximity sensor).

5. The software running on **fridgeNode** must be able to:
- comunicate with **robot** and **maitre**. **-------------------------------------------**

Appunti da ste: il prof nell'analisi dei requisiti dice 
"The software running on the robotNode must execute the commands sent by the **human-user** via the console and must be sensible to a set of conditions. Let us name, from now on, such a set with the term envConds."
Noi dovremmo dire che deve eseguire i comandi inviati dal maitre via smartphone ?
